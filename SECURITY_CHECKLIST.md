# Security Checklist - Quick Reference

## Pre-Production Deployment

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Must Fix)

- [ ] **Remove/Change Default Passwords**
  - [ ] Seeder passwords changed to strong random values
  - [ ] No hardcoded passwords in code
  - [ ] Admin default password set via environment variable

- [x] **Filter Sensitive Data in Frontend**
  - [x] User object in Inertia props only exposes safe fields (implemented)
  - [x] Password hash not exposed
  - [x] Two-factor secret not exposed
  - [x] Recovery codes not exposed
  - [x] Remember token not exposed

### ðŸŸ  HIGH Priority

- [x] **File Upload Security**
  - [x] MIME type validation implemented (ImageUploadService)
  - [x] File content validation (Intervention Image read)
  - [x] Image re-encoding to strip metadata / re-encode
  - [x] Secure filename generation (random, unpredictable)
  - [x] File size limits enforced (2MB default)
  - [x] Secure file deletion with path validation

- [x] **HTTPS Configuration**
  - [x] HTTPS enforced in production (AppServiceProvider forces scheme)
  - [ ] `APP_URL` uses https:// in production (check env)
  - [ ] `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true` (verify .env)
  - [x] HSTS header enabled via SecurityHeaders middleware (production only)

- [x] **Security Headers**
  - [x] `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` (SecurityHeaders middleware)
  - [x] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - [x] `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - [x] `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS, production only)
  - [x] `Referrer-Policy`
  - [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) â€” not yet configured, recommended to use spatie/laravel-csp

- [x] **Authorization (partial)**
  - [x] All admin routes protected with middleware (`auth`, `verified`, `can:admin`) â€” see `routes/admin.php`
  - [x] Gate implemented for `admin` role (AppServiceProvider) â€” consider adding Policies for resources
  - [ ] Authorization tests written
  - [ ] No role-based vulnerabilities (manual review recommended)

- [x] **Security Logging (skeleton implemented)**
  - [x] SecurityLogger service added (logs to `security` channel) â€” file exists at `app/Services/SecurityLogger.php`
  - [ ] Integrate logging into auth flow (LoginRequest) and other places
  - [ ] Configure `security` channel retention (config/logging.php). NOTE: `config/logging.php` currently does not include a `security` channel and should be updated.

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM Priority

- [ ] **Session Security**
  - [ ] `SESSION_LIFETIME=30` (30 minutes)
  - [ ] `SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE=true`
  - [ ] `SESSION_ENCRYPT=true`
  - [ ] `AUTH_PASSWORD_TIMEOUT=900` (15 minutes)

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**
  - [ ] Global rate limiting enabled (120/min per IP)
  - [ ] Login throttling: 5 attempts
  - [ ] Password reset throttling
  - [ ] 2FA throttling: 5 attempts/min
  - [ ] API rate limiting (if applicable)

- [x] **Activity Logging (scaffold added)**
  - [x] Spatie Activity Log trait added to `User` model (scaffold) and `spatie/laravel-activitylog` appears in `composer.json`
  - [ ] Publish migrations & run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=activitylog-migrations` and `php artisan migrate`
  - [ ] Configure retention & channels in `config/activitylog.php`
  - [ ] Verify activity logging works end-to-end after migrations

- [ ] **Data Exposure Prevention**
  - [ ] Pagination data filtered before sending to frontend (user lists may include full model attributes; consider resource transformers)
  - [ ] API responses don't include internal data
  - [ ] Error messages don't leak system info

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW Priority

- [ ] **Additional Security Measures**
  - [ ] CSP properly configured
  - [ ] Cookie security flags set
  - [ ] CORS configured (if API exists)
  - [ ] Database backup automated
  - [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup

## Environment Configuration

### Production .env Settings

```env
# Application
APP_NAME=YourAppName
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Security
APP_KEY=base64:... # Strong key
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Session
SESSION_DRIVER=database
SESSION_LIFETIME=30
SESSION_EXPIRE_ON_CLOSE=true
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax

# Authentication
AUTH_PASSWORD_TIMEOUT=900

# Logging
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_LEVEL=error

# Cache & Queue
CACHE_STORE=redis  # or database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

# Database
DB_CONNECTION=mysql  # or postgresql
# ... secure credentials

# Mail
# ... configure with secure SMTP

# Optional: Security Headers
CSP_ENABLED=true
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=false
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run security tests specifically
php artisan test --filter=SecurityTest

# Static analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Code style
./vendor/bin/pint --test

# Dependency audit
composer audit
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### Manual Security Testing

- [ ] **Authentication Tests**
  - [ ] Try login with wrong password (should rate limit after 5 attempts)
  - [ ] Check session expires after inactivity
  - [ ] Verify 2FA works correctly
  - [ ] Test password reset flow

- [ ] **Authorization Tests**
  - [ ] Try accessing `/admin/*` without login (should redirect)
  - [ ] Try accessing admin pages with user role (should 403)
  - [ ] Test that users can't modify other users' data
  - [ ] Verify admin can't delete themselves

- [ ] **Input Validation Tests**
  - [ ] Try XSS injection in forms: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
  - [ ] Try SQL injection: `' OR 1=1--`
  - [ ] Upload malicious files (PHP, executable)
  - [ ] Test file size limits
  - [ ] Try path traversal: `../../etc/passwd`

- [ ] **Data Exposure Tests**
  - [ ] Check browser console/network tab for sensitive data
  - [ ] Verify passwords not visible in responses
  - [ ] Check that error messages don't leak info

- [ ] **HTTPS & Headers Tests**
  - [ ] Visit site via HTTP (should redirect to HTTPS)
  - [ ] Check security headers in browser DevTools
  - [ ] Verify HSTS header present
  - [ ] Test CSP doesn't block legitimate resources

## Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor

- [ ] Failed login attempts (spike = possible attack)
- [ ] Account lockouts (repeated lockouts = targeted attack)
- [ ] Unusual file uploads (large files, suspicious types)
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts (403 errors)
- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts
- [ ] Unusual user behavior (access patterns)
- [ ] Server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Database query performance (slow queries)

### Logging Locations

```
storage/logs/laravel.log          # General application logs
storage/logs/security.log         # Security events (if configured)
```

### Log Analysis Commands

```bash
# View recent security logs
tail -f storage/logs/security.log

# Count failed login attempts
grep "Failed login" storage/logs/security.log | wc -l

# List locked accounts
grep "Account locked" storage/logs/security.log

# Find suspicious IPs
grep "Unauthorized access" storage/logs/security.log | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
