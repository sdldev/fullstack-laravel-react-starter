### 🟢 LOW Priority

- [x] **Additional Security Measures** ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
  - [ ] CSP properly configured (optional; see `docs/CSP_CONFIGURATION.md` for implementation guide)
  - [x] Cookie security flags set (`http_only=true`, `same_site=lax`, `secure` in production)
  - [x] CORS configured (default Laravel CORS handling)

## Testing Checklist

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run security tests specifically
php artisan test --filter=SecurityTest

# Static analysis
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse

# Code style
./vendor/bin/pint --test

# Dependency audit
composer audit
npm audit --audit-level=high
```

### Manual Security Testing

- [ ] **Authentication Tests**
  - [ ] Try login with wrong password (should rate limit after 5 attempts)
  - [ ] Check session expires after inactivity
  - [ ] Verify 2FA works correctly
  - [ ] Test password reset flow

- [ ] **Authorization Tests**
  - [ ] Try accessing `/admin/*` without login (should redirect)
  - [ ] Try accessing admin pages with user role (should 403)
  - [ ] Test that users can't modify other users' data
  - [ ] Verify admin can't delete themselves

- [ ] **Input Validation Tests**
  - [ ] Try XSS injection in forms: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
  - [ ] Try SQL injection: `' OR 1=1--`
  - [ ] Upload malicious files (PHP, executable)
  - [ ] Test file size limits
  - [ ] Try path traversal: `../../etc/passwd`

- [ ] **Data Exposure Tests**
  - [ ] Check browser console/network tab for sensitive data
  - [ ] Verify passwords not visible in responses
  - [ ] Check that error messages don't leak info

- [ ] **HTTPS & Headers Tests**
  - [ ] Visit site via HTTP (should redirect to HTTPS)
  - [ ] Check security headers in browser DevTools
  - [ ] Verify HSTS header present
  - [ ] Test CSP doesn't block legitimate resources

## Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor

- [ ] Failed login attempts (spike = possible attack)
- [ ] Account lockouts (repeated lockouts = targeted attack)
- [ ] Unusual file uploads (large files, suspicious types)
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts (403 errors)
- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts
- [ ] Unusual user behavior (access patterns)
- [ ] Server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Database query performance (slow queries)

### Logging Locations

```
storage/logs/laravel.log          # General application logs
storage/logs/security.log         # Security events (if configured)
```

### Log Analysis Commands

```bash
# View recent security logs
tail -f storage/logs/security.log

# Count failed login attempts
grep "Failed login" storage/logs/security.log | wc -l

# List locked accounts
grep "Account locked" storage/logs/security.log

# Find suspicious IPs
grep "Unauthorized access" storage/logs/security.log | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```
